Rotbot framework:
a event and keyword driven test framework

python based, can be extended using java when running on jython

user defines is own keyword library(many third party libs available) and use them in test cases

when executing a test case, use the following files as input
1) the test case itself
2) user defined keyword library(written in python)
3) the app to be tested

1) test cases format is defined by robot frame work
	test can be written in a key-word driven way, or in a cucumber/gherkin way. ( the test cases would be in a human readable way so that is easily understood by business ppl)
		Given some precondition
        And some other precondition
       	When some action by the actor
       	And some other action
       	And yet another action
      	Then some testable outcome is achieved
       	And something else we can check happens too

2) library takes the testable as parameter and iteratacts with it
	the push_button() method will correspond to Push Button keyworkd in the test case

3) the app could be as simple as a Class or as complex as an app
	the lib can be extended in either python or java
